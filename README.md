## Multi Criteria Decision Making
---
This project uses DEA/TOPSIS to judge the **Best Option** analytically between multiple available options taking into account both **Input (Cost)** and **Output (Benefit)** into account

### Multiple Options to be Selected From
---
Here, we are trying to select the best 'IP'amongst multiple options. Each Option has its own **strengths (Blue Columns)** and **drawbacks (Red Columns)**. Broadly speaking, we want to select the Option that minimizes the drawbacks or costs while maximizing the benefits

DEA (or TOPSIS) helps us score these options analytically generating an **efficiency** measure between 0-1 helping us rank the Options taking into account any number of **strengths (Blue Columns)** and **drawbacks (Red Columns)**

The difference between DEA and TOPSIS being that TOPSIS explicitly asks for a **Weighting** of the Criterias of the user while DEA figures it out automatically
