## Multi Criteria Decision Making
---
This project uses DEA/TOPSIS to judge the **Best Option** analytically between multiple available options taking into account both **Input (Cost)** and **Output (Benefit)** into account

### Multiple Options to be Selected From
---
We have to select the best amongst multiple options. Each Option has its own strengths and drawbacks. Broadly speaking, we want to select the Option that minimizes the drawbacks or costs while maximizing the benefits
